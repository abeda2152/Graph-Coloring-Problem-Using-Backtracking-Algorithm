# GraphGUI
##Purpose
**To implement several graph algorithms with the use of visualization**

App is written in *java programming language - compile with Netbeans*, please suggest changes if you think any should be made.
We are working on running several algorithms and making an efficient way to visualize how they work.

**Algorithms covered so far:** 
- Bfs
- Dfs
- You can find all cut vertices (Using Dfs)
- Check if graph is bipartite (Using Bfs)
- Make tree from graph/Check if graph is a tree
- Given Graph G, double the graph (G^2)
- Graph Coloring
- Check connectedness
- Find Euler path
- Find Euler Cycle

**How to Use**
- Clone source (Note: you can only compile with Netbeans)
- Open project in Netbeans
- Run the application

**Controls**
- Left click to place vertices
- Left Click and Drag mouse to place edges between vertices
- Right click to remove vertex
- Middle click and Drag to move vertex around
- Double click to choose start vertex and destination vertex (Colors and label will be updated).
- Click dropdown to select an algorithm to run
- Click start
- CTRL O to open
- CTRL N for new file
- CTRL S to save
- CTRL SHIFT S to save as
- CTRL Q to Quit
